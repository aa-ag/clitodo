# CLI To-Do app

Creating a To-do app using Python to be used via CLI following class from (RealPython)[https://realpython.com/python-typer-cli/].

In class, the project is broken down into 12 sections, and it's more of an article than a follow along class;  here, you will only find the relevant scripts to make the app run.

Because the class shows a version of this project with several dependencies, a virtual env was created: `conda activate clitodo`
